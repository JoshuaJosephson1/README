Building infrastructure for AI agents that run anywhere — local, edge, offline.

Most agent tooling assumes a cloud-first world. I'm building the systems layer for agents that don't need one.

**Currently working on:**
- Runtime and orchestration tooling for local-first AI agents
- Lightweight eval and observability
- Bringing discipline to the stacck
